# Bachelor-thesis

This repository contains several building extraction models which I practiced over time. The task was originally my bachelor thesis project **building extraction with convolutional neural network**, when I used pixel based segmentation only, and non-efficient seen from now. Since then there are many more effective deep learning algorithms, I tested several of which and collect them here. I'll also try to keep updating it.

## Current tested models

1. Pixel based segmentation: simple CNN & Residual Network

2. Fully convolutional neural network, based on the paper [Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/html/Long_Fully_Convolutional_Networks_2015_CVPR_paper.html)

3. U-Net, based on the paper [U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net/)
