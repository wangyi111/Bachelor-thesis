Building extraction with modified U-Net based on the paper [BRRNet: A Fully Convolutional Neural Network for Automatic Building Extraction From High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/6/1050).

This is a draft version to make sure the code is runnable, details to be added later.
