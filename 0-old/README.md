original codes of the bachelor thesis [Deep learning based Building extraction from high resolution remote sensing images](https://github.com/wangyi111/Bachelor-thesis/blob/master/old/2014302590083_thesis.pdf)


**main contents:** compare simple CNN and ResNet for building extraction on [ISPRS dataset](http://www2.isprs.org/commissions/comm3/wg4/tests.html)

**note:** pixel based sementic segmentation, which is out of date. I put it here as a benchmark for later.
